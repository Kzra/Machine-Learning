Machine Learning Week 9 D 
Recommender Systems

Algorithms that can 'learn' what features it should use.

Example: 
Predicting movie ratings 

User rates movies using zero to five stars 

Movie Alice Bob John Jeremy 
Love  
Dog  
Trucks

nu = number of users 
nm = number of films
r(i,j) = 1 if user j has rated film i
y(i,j) = rating given by user j to film i (define only if r(i,j) = 1) 

recommender system problem...predict what a user will rate film

content-based
create features that describe films, each film can be represented by a feature vector 

x1(romance) 
x2(action) 
n = 2
each value in feature vector correspodns to a different film 

for each user, learn a parameter theta - Rn+1. Predict user j as rating move i with theta'x starts 
each user is associsated witha  unique parameter vector 

so what does alice think of trucks?
x3 = x0+romance+action
x3 = [1;0.99;0]
theta 1 ' x3 = 4.95.

How to learn parameter theta j 
1/2m(j)*sum(r,i,j=1) thetaj'X(i) - iy(i,j)^2 + lambda/2m(j) *sumk=1:n(theta(j,k)^2
sum all the films user j has rated
learn theta(j) 
minimise this u will get a good prediction of user js film ratings

then use theta and apply to content description of new films, and predict whether they will like them
