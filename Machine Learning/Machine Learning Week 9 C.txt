Multivariate Gaussian Distribution 
An extension of standard gaussian anomaly detection, can catch more examples. 

normal gaussian detection won't understand linear relationships without explicit features
so use multivariate...
model p(x) all in one go, not separately 

parameters p(x;u;SIGMA) 
u = mean(vector of features)
SIGMA = n*n covar matrix
p(x;u;SIGMA) = 1/(2PI)*n/2*|SIGMA|^1/2

|SIGMA| = determinant of sigma 

can be used to model correlations between data
SIGMA = [1,0.5;0.5,1]
will give a linear pos correlation gaussian distribution 

or SIGMA = [1,-0.5;-0.5,1]
neg correlation

vary u, varies peak of distribution 

using Multivariate Gaussian Distribution in anomaly detection: 
fitting parameters 

u = 1/m*sum(x) 
sigma = 1/m*sum(x-u)(x-u)'

1. fit model p(x) by setting u and sigma
2. given a new example x, compute p(x) 
flag an anomaly if p(x) < sigma 

relationship to original model 
original model corresponds to multivariate gaussian where contours of model are axis aligned 
ie u can use multivariate gaussian to give normal, if multivariate gaussian is constrained to axis 

when to use original vs multivariate? 
original: 
manually create features to capture unusual combinations of values
computationally cheaper, scales better
okay if m is small

multivariate:
automatically capture
expensive, have to convert inverse of SIGMA
won't work if you have redundant features, i.e. x3 = x4 + x5 
must have m>n or else SIGMA is non invertible 
use only if m > 10n
