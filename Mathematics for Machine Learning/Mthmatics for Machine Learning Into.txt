Mathematics for Machine Learning Week 1 

Multivariate calculus - how the thing we are trying to optimise changes with changes to the parameters that describe it.
Pen and paper mathematics is not a useful skill in the world of computers. The ideas behing the mathematics is. 

Linear algebra - the study of vectors, vector spaces and mapping between spaces. Came about by intuition that linear equations could be solved by using vectors. 

What sort of problems can we solve with linear algebra?
2apples + 3bananas = 8 euros 
10 applies + 1banana = 13 euros 

solve simultaneous equations to discover individual prices.
how can we do this with a computer algorithm? 
this is a linear algebra problem 
constansts linear coefficients, and some cost to solve.
(2,3;10,1)*[a;b] = [8;13]


another problem: fitting an equation to data. 
how to find optimum values of parameters to describe the line that fits a histogram (say) of all the popualtion ages
we can then use the equation to describe the data, without needing all the data beneath it. 

Get a handle on Vectors: 
vectors can represent a move down parameter space 

operations with vectors:
vectors can be seen as an object that moves us about space
physical space, or a space of data. geometric object starting at the origin 

in data science vectors can be seen as things that describe an object.

a vector is an entity that abides two rules: 
1. addition
2. multiplication by a scalar number 

vector addition is associative. 
if we have three vectors: r,s,t
it doesn't matter whether we do 
(r + s) + t
or s + (r + t)
etc.

vector subtraction is addition of -1 * (X) 
r - r = 0 

multiplication by a scalar. 2r = 2*components of r 

i [1;0] and j [0;1] are called the fundamental basis vectors, and are the co-ordinates that define the space
