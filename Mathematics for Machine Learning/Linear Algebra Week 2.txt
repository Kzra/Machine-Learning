Length of a vector = Size
irrespective of the co-ordinate system we use, how to calculate the length of a vector and the direction it is going in
r = [a;b]
|r| =  sqrt(a^2+b^2)
size of a vector is defined as the sums of the squares of its component square rooted. regardless of context. 
modulus of r

Dot product of a vector:

multiplying two vectors together to give a scalar product 
1.the dot product is commutative 
r dot s is equal to s dot r

2.dot product is distributive over addition
r dot (s + t) is the same (r dot s) + (r dot t) 

3.also associatvie over scalar multplication
r.(a.s) == a.(r.s) 

4.finally a vectors dot product with itself is equal to the size ^2
r.r = |size|^2
r.r == ri^2 + rj^2 

Cosine & dot product: 
cosine rule:
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2*a*b cos(theta)
c^2 = |r-s|^2 = |r| + |s| - 2 |r||s| * cos (theta) 
|r-s|^2 = (r-s)(r-s)  = |r|^2 - 2s.r + |s|^2
cancel out 
s.r = |r||s|cos(theta)

dot product of vectors tells us the extent to which two vectors go in the same direction by multiplying by the angle between them
if cos(90) = 0 
r.s = 0
cos(0) = 1 
r.s = 1
cos(180)
r.s = - |r|*|s|

if two vectors are orthogonal the dot product will be zero 
if they are pointed in the same direction the dot product = = |r|*|s|
if they are in opposite directions dot product will be -1
